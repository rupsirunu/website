            <h2>RUPASHREE SAHOO</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I am Rupashree Sahoo from Deogarh, Odisha. I try to be myself, be passionate about my dreams and hobbies, live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make. I am a dedicated student working toward the future where I can strong. Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. Many of those friends who surround me now I met on the street while doing my hobby. I’m in love with photography, so the thing I love doing so much became even more enjoyable. I decided to take beautiful pictures of accidental people and share these photos with them by emails or in social media. I feel happiness inside seeing how happy they are looking at the pictures where they are walking or sitting somewhere in the park. In this way, Liza became my best friend and we both believe that we meant to meet because she studies the same classes and we have similar life goals. The goal I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself. Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now: grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. With all I already have, I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well. </p>

            <h1 class="headings">Website Design</h1>
            <p>Web design is the process of creating a website. It can be for an ecommerce site or a blog, but anything related to the appearance of a website falls under the “design” umbrella.“Don’t be afraid to be inspired by other people. New designers tend to want to create something totally unique, but don’t be afraid to be referential to things that are working. As long as there’s a rationale behind your design, don’t be deterred from trying new things, either.” </p>

            <h1 class="headings">3d Design</h1>
            <p>3D product design is the creation of a product in a virtual environment in which it has three dimensions (height, width, and depth). ... 3D design makes your life as a product designer easier and faster, allowing you to devote more time and energy to optimizing your product. The elements of design are the fundamental aspects of any visual design which include shape, color, space, form, line, value, and texture. Graphic designers use the elements of design to create an image that can convey a certain mood, draw the eye in a certain direction, or evoke a number of feelings.</p>

            <h1 class="headings">Coding</h1>
            <p>The definition of coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using programming languages. Computer code is used to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day. If you pay any attention to tech, you've undoubtedly heard the terms coding and programming dozens of times. However, like anything new, it's not easy to start, and how difficult a time one has with learning to code will vary across a number of factors. The point is, learning to code isn't impossible; or, it's not as impossible as it might seem when it comes to getting your kids involved.</p>
